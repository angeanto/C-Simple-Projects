Assume we have a gas pump and we want to fill our car with fuel. User gives cost per litre ( 1<= cost <=2) and fills car's tank. 
Each press adds 0.5L . We also assume , gas tank's maximum capacity is 50 L .
Clearly program needs improvement when cin.get()!= "enter" because numberOfLitres continues to count.
